        <p class="description">A monster with a distinctive tail.<br>
            While it is omnivorous, it has a preference for fruit, and keeps various fruits with all kinds of effects in
            its belly pouch.<br>
            An incredibly curious beast, it enjoys playing tricks on people, and has been seen to bat fruit at its prey
            using its tail.
